### @misakey/helpers

```shell
yarn add @misakey/helpers
```

For scalability and robustness, we import all helpers from [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) into this package.

We also add our own helpers, and sometime update the logic of the helpers from the libraries to match our internal logic.
